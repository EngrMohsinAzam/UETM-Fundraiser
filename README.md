# UETM-Fundraiser
A Decentralized Ethereum-Based Fundraising Platform for Educational Institutions  This is my final year project: a smart contract-powered platform that enables universities and educational institutions to raise funds transparently using Ethereum blockchain. It ensures security, transparency, and decentralization in the donation process.
